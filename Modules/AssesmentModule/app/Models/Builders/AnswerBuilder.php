 * Class AnswerBuilder

 * It includes methods for filtering answers by attributes such as `attempt_id`, `question_id`, `selected_option_id`, 
 * `answer_text`, `is_correct`, `score`, and other related fields. The `filter()` method applies multiple filters 
 * dynamically based on the provided filters array.
